# EGW (test task solution)

- The server side is implemented on the basis of **Node.js**.
- The client side is implemented on the basis of **React**.

Additional technologies that were used in the project:
- **TypeScript**, **SASS**, **express**, **puppeteer**, **cherio**, etc.


## Setup and launch

Start the proxy server on http://localhost:8080
```bash
cd server
npm i
npm start
```

Start client on http://localhost:3000

```bash
cd client
npm i
npm run dev
```

## P.S.
*It was interesting for me to work on this task, I hope I managed to implement the intended business logic. I plan to continue to improve this work, so I will be very glad to hear any feedback*


**Thank you for your attention and may the force be with you!**
